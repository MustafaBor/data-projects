    "# Traction Analysis of Free Mobile Apps\n",
    "\n",
    "This project presents a simple analysis to determine popularity and user satisfaction of free apps in the App Store and Google Play Store with an emphasis on app genres. The focus here is free apps that rely on advertisements for revenue generation. The main idea behind the analysis is to provide data-driven decisions that help app developers idenfity the type of apps that would likely to gain traction among users and present opportunities for ad generated revenues.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to Data Sets\n",
    "The data used in this project is a subset of over five million apps that are available in both stores. There are two sources of data sets that are freely available online and can be used as sample without incurring additional time and cost that would be required to compile data sets for the entire market.\n",

    "\n",
    "* The [second data set](https://www.kaggle.com/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps) contains close to 7200 iOS apps from the App Store and is available for download [here](https://dq-content.s3.amazonaws.com/350/AppleStore.csv)\n",

It also does not seem to provide information to complement what we have already observed earlier. Furthermore, the granularity makes it difficult to make meaningful inferences and there appears to be conflicting information between the tables. For example, the entertainment for the categories table returns 0.96% whereas the entertainment for the genres table returns 6.07%. Perhaps this would be more understandable if the table with less entries had a higher portion of the percentages; after all there are more entries the percentages would have to be distributed, but in this case it appears to be the opposite.\n",

One way to examine this is to examine the number of downloads which reveals the user interest in the products. The Google Play data set contains a column named `Installs` which is exactly what we are looking for. However, such information is missing in the App Store data set. Observing the columns in this data set we see a column named `rating_count_tot`, which indicates the total number of ratings for a given app. This would presumably give us a smaller number of data points compared to installations as not every user who installs the app leaves a rating on the website, but it should suffice as a substitute to total number of downloads for our purposes.\n",

The games category is particularly appealing with 5 apps holding just over one fifth of the market. Communications is another category that we examined earlier that might have potential. In the App Store we concluded that the weather category will likely be suitable for our purposes, so we might want to look at the distribution in that genre in the Play Store."

    "If we would like to target both the Android and the iOS markets we might want to entertain the idea of combining categories/genres, which would target both markets to some degree and also provide a more refreshing look and functionality which might appeal to new users. This way we would target both stores without excluding a potential segment in either store and bring in a potentially novel idea. For instance, given our observations on both data sets perhaps there would be a way to integrate the game and weather categories, our top categories for each store, to appeal potential users. The same could hold true for weather and communication categories, and the possibilities for combining genres/categories in novel ways would have to be explored by the developer based on abilities, creativity and personal preferrence.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this project, we analyzed data utilizing the Android and iOS mobile app data sets publicly available on the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) website in order to understand the traction and popularity of free apps based on a number of criteria, including genre distribution, installation numbers and review counts. The main goal of the analysis was to help a potential app developer to decide on the type of app they might want to invest in, especially with the idea of revenue generation via advertisements for free apps, which for the most part depends on popularity and number of active users.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, we determined that different genres (weather for the iOS market and games for the Android market) seem more suitable for each store, although we tried to emphasize other potential genres, such as communications and productivity, besides our initial recommendation. We proposed the idea of creating an app combining two genres for developers who would prefer to target both the Android and iOS landscape, which would not only cover both markets but also introduce a novel idea in combining different genres in the hopes of appealing to potential users."
